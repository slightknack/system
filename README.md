# system

This is a place where I can share system prompts. Each prompt uses Markdown. The file format is:

```
NN-prompt-name.md
```

Where `NN` is the prompt number.

Additionally, prompts have frontmatter. The format is:

```
---
name: "Prompt Name"
model: model-version-size
---

{{ prompt }}
```

All system prompts in this repo are licensed under `GPL-3.0` because if you improve upon a prompt I've written I'd love to see those improvements published. (Of course, this license does not apply to any outputs you may generate using these prompts. (Unless your models were trained on GPL'd data, I guess. (Who knows?)))
